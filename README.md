# ReadME Generator
## Week 9 Challenge

---

## Scope
This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

There will be a main page that will run the application with the prompted questions
> index.js

A .js page for our parent class of Employee with children classes of Intern, Manager, and Engineer
> Employee.js Intern.js Manager.js Engineer.js

This application requires having test suites for each of those previous pages
> Employee.test.js Intern.test.js Manager.test.js Engineer.test.js

Finally, this will output an html into the distribution folder
> ./dist/finalHtml.html
